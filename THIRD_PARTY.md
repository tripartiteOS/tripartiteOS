> [!IMPORTANT]
> MS-DOS 5.0 or 6.x is not distributed with tripartiteOS, and is not open-source. You must supply your own copy of MS-DOS to run tripartiteOS. While MS-DOS is often referred to as "abandonware," this term has no legal standing, so legally we cannot provide a copy of MS-DOS. FreeDOS may work but we didn't bother testing
